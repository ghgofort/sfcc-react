# sfcc-react
sfcc-react is a React Native mobile application that uses Sales Force Commerce Cloud or SFCC (formerly Demandware) and their Open Commerce API (OCAPI) to read and write to an SFCC instance. The app uses the Redux framework for global state management and redux-thunk for handling ASYNC action creation methods in order to make calls to OCAPI.

The repo is still in the setup phase and there is still a large amout of work left to do. Check back soon to see more.
